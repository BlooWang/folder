= Overview =

Advanced RAR Password Recovery (ARPR) is a password retrieval program for the RAR/WinRAR archiving format.

The key features of ARPR are:

- ARPR has a convenient and easy to use user interface;
- ARPR works with one protected file at a time (multiple uses of ARPR is possible);
- all compression methods are supported;
- self-extracting archives are supported;
- you can select the custom character set for "brute-force" attack (non-English characters are supported);
- you can interrupt the program at any time. Resuming is supported;
- ARPR can work in the background, using the CPU only when it is in an idle state;
- ARPR can utilise either a customizable "brute-force" approach, or an effective dictionary-based approach. The different approaches can be used for all RAR types and compression methods using AES (Rijndael) 128-bit encryption, e.g., set the password length (range) of the character set used to generate the passwords, and many other options;
- A multilingual interface is provided.


= Known bugs and limitations =

- If the archive contains only one encrypted file and it is "stored" (without compression, just with encryption) -- the performance might be lower than expected, especially on large files, because decrypting the whole file is required.
- For RAR archives created in versions 2.9 and 3.x, the recovery speed is extremely low (due to very strong encryption).
- Some multi-volume archives are not supported
